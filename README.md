Building my full stack web application helped me learn different frontend development methods, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA). Express HTML and JavaScript allowed me to create simple, dynamic web pages, while the SPA provided a smoother user experience by updating content without reloading the page. The SPA was the best choice for making the app feel fast and responsive, as it allowed users to navigate without waiting for full-page refreshes.

For the backend, I used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it is flexible and easy to scale. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it simple to work with JavaScript-based technologies like this one. This was useful because my application needed to handle different types of user-generated content, like log-in information and new trip data. MongoDB also works well with Node.js, making it a natural choice for connecting the frontend and backend smoothly.

A key part of this project was understanding how JSON works and why it is different from JavaScript. JSON is a format used to send and receive data between the frontend and backend. It is lightweight and easy to read, making it perfect for transferring information between different parts of the application. I also improved my code by refactoring it, which made it cleaner and more efficient. For example, I optimized database queries to reduce unnecessary calls, making the app run faster. I also created reusable UI components, such as form validation and authentication features, which saved time and ensured a consistent user experience.

Testing was an important part of building my application, especially when working with API endpoints and security features. I learned how different HTTP methods, like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allow the frontend to interact with the backend. Testing these endpoints helped ensure the app worked correctly. Security added an extra challenge because I needed to protect user data. Using JWT authentication and middleware security required testing authorization tokens and session management to prevent unauthorized access. Despite these difficulties, thorough testing made the application more secure and reliable.

This course has helped me grow as a developer and gain important skills for my career. I now have experience in full stack development, including frontend and backend integration, API development, database management, and security best practices. I also improved my ability to write clean and maintainable code. Learning to refactor code and create reusable components has made my applications more efficient. Additionally, I gained experience with authentication, data storage, and security, which are essential for building professional web applications.

Overall, this course has made me more confident in my ability to develop secure, scalable applications. The skills Iâ€™ve learned will help me stand out in the job market, and I now feel better prepared to work on real-world web development projects.
